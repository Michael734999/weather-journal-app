<h1>Weather Journal App</h1>
<p>
I created this weather journal app using:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Express and Async JavaScript</li>
</ul>
This was a very fun project and I enjoyed building it a lot. I gained a lot of new skills throughout the build of this project.

The port that I used on the server-end was port 3000.
